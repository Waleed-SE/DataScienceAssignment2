# 🔌 Predicting Electricity Demand: A Data Science Journey  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand using data science techniques. The dataset consists of electricity consumption and weather data, which have been merged, cleaned, and analyzed before building a regression model to predict demand.  

## 📂 Workflow  
### 1️⃣ Data Integration  
- Merged electricity demand and weather datasets using an inner join on standardized timestamps.  

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering  
- Extracted time-based features (hour, day, month, season).  
- Encoded categorical variables (subba-name, season, etc.).  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Performed statistical analysis and data visualization.  
- Identified trends, correlations, and anomalies.  

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning & Normalization  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Scaled numerical features for improved model performance.  

### 5️⃣ Regression Modeling  
- Built and evaluated a regression model to predict electricity demand.  
- Assessed performance using RMSE, MSE, and R² score.
